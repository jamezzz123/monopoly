## simple calculation

there are 40 positions in the monopoly board and to go round all 40 positions that 100% of the SVG path. so we need to find the percentage required to move to a single position on the board.

based on my calculations
1/40 = 0.025; 

so to move to one position to the next position it need to be moved 0.025% of the SVG path.
